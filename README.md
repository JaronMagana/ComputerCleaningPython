Hello, 

This is the computer cleaning app. I use it to clean up my desktop and downloads to specific files for easier cleaning. I currently use spyder 3.7 from the anaconda navigation tab. I have not tried it on python ide or in python 2.7 applications so I do not know if they work. You are free to try. It does not currently do anything to normal files without what it determines to be extensions (files with . in them). I might add that as a dialogue feature in the future.
